Technical Questions
What is Flutter, and why would you choose it for mobile app development?

Flutter is an open-source UI toolkit by Google that allows for the creation of natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It's preferred for its high performance, widget-based approach, and ease of use in creating multi-platform applications.
What are Stateful and Stateless widgets in Flutter?

Stateless widgets are immutable; they don’t change once created, like Text or Icon. Stateful widgets hold a mutable state that can be modified, like Checkbox or Slider, and they re-render when their state changes.
Explain the widget tree in Flutter.

The widget tree is a hierarchical structure that Flutter uses to represent the UI. Every widget is a node, and they’re nested to build complex UIs. Modifying one widget may cause Flutter to rebuild only part of the tree, improving efficiency.
How does Flutter handle state management?

State management in Flutter can be handled with various approaches, including Provider, BLoC, Riverpod, and GetX. Each approach has its benefits, and the choice depends on the app's complexity and scalability needs.
How would you implement dependency injection in Flutter?

Using Provider, GetIt, or Riverpod, you can inject dependencies for services, repositories, or controllers, enabling a modular, testable app architecture.
Explain the use of setState() in Flutter.

setState() is used in Stateful widgets to notify the framework that a widget’s state has changed, triggering a rebuild for the specific widget.
What are some advantages of using Dart as Flutter’s programming language?

Dart is optimized for UI, with a fast development cycle, smooth animations, a garbage-collected runtime, and an ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation that boosts performance.
How does Flutter achieve a high frame rate?

Flutter's widgets are rendered directly using Skia, a graphics engine, bypassing native UI components, which reduces lag and enables consistent 60fps or higher.

How does Flutter’s hot reload work?

Hot reload injects updated source code into the running Dart VM, retaining the state and allowing faster development cycles.
Explain the importance of testing in Flutter applications.

Testing ensures code stability, prevents regressions, and boosts confidence in delivering production-ready applications.
How do you use CI/CD in Flutter?

By setting up workflows with tools like GitHub Actions or CircleCI, you automate testing, building, and deploying processes for seamless delivery.
What’s the role of unit testing and widget testing in Flutter?

Unit testing validates business logic, while widget testing verifies UI components. Both are essential for app stability.
Explain asynchronous programming in Dart.

Using Future and async-await enables non-blocking operations, allowing tasks to run in the background while maintaining UI responsiveness.
What’s a singleton pattern, and how can you use it in Flutter?

A singleton pattern restricts a class to a single instance, ideal for service classes and managers like DatabaseManager.
How would you debug an issue in Flutter?

Using tools like Flutter DevTools, print statements, breakpoints, and the debugPrint method for in-depth debugging.
What is the use of Lottie animations in Flutter?

Technical & Conceptual Questions
What’s a widget test, and how does it differ from an integration test?

A widget test checks a specific widget's behavior in isolation to ensure it appears and behaves as expected. It’s faster and focuses on a single widget or UI component. An integration test, however, verifies the full application flow, testing how various widgets interact within the app, often involving multiple screens, databases, and API calls. Integration tests are slower but ensure the app functions as expected when components are combined.
How does Flutter handle gestures and touch events?

Flutter uses GestureDetector and other gesture-recognition widgets to detect user input events, such as taps, drags, and swipes. These widgets wrap around the widget tree, allowing you to add gesture recognition functionality. Flutter’s gesture system is both efficient and flexible, providing low-level (e.g., PointerDownEvent) and high-level gesture recognizers for more complex interactions.
Explain Navigator 2.0 and how it differs from Navigator 1.0.

Navigator 1.0 uses a stack-based approach for routing and navigation, which is simple but limited, especially for complex navigation flows. Navigator 2.0 provides more control by separating the app’s navigation structure from the UI, supporting declarative navigation and allowing the use of different routes and deep linking more efficiently. Navigator 2.0 is better suited for web applications or apps requiring complex navigation states.
Describe the benefits of using async generators in Dart.

Async generators, created with async* and yield, allow you to produce a series of values asynchronously, one at a time. They’re useful when you need to handle a stream of data, such as paginated API requests or real-time updates, without blocking the main thread. Async generators are memory-efficient and can simplify handling long-running data streams.
What is the use of InheritedNotifier?

InheritedNotifier is a widget that provides efficient data propagation and notification across the widget tree. Unlike InheritedWidget, InheritedNotifier works with a ChangeNotifier to notify child widgets only when there’s an actual data change. It’s useful for performance optimization, as it minimizes rebuilds and is commonly used in state management.
How do you set up push notifications in Flutter?

You can set up push notifications in Flutter by integrating Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) with the firebase_messaging package. The setup includes configuring Firebase in the app, implementing platform-specific code (Android and iOS), handling notification permissions, and managing incoming notifications to show alerts or update the app state.
What is pubspec.yaml?

pubspec.yaml is the configuration file for a Flutter or Dart project. It defines dependencies, assets, package versions, and metadata like app name and version. When dependencies are listed here, Flutter fetches them during build time, making pubspec.yaml essential for managing libraries and assets in your project.
How do you reduce app size in Flutter?

To reduce app size, you can use Flutter’s flutter build commands with --split-per-abi (for Android), remove unused resources, compress images, and use deferred components to load only the necessary assets. Minifying code and excluding unnecessary packages also help reduce the final APK or IPA size.
How do you handle offline data in Flutter apps?

Handling offline data can be achieved by using packages like sqflite for local databases or hive for NoSQL storage. For seamless sync, you can store data locally and implement periodic syncing with the server when online. Adding connectivity checks also helps manage offline scenarios effectively.
What is a custom painter in Flutter, and when would you use it?

CustomPainter is used to create custom graphics by drawing directly on the canvas, like complex shapes, animations, or charts. It’s helpful when you need custom designs or visualizations not achievable with standard widgets. However, it requires a deeper understanding of the canvas and paint objects.
