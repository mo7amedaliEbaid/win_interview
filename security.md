1. What are the key security principles you would follow in developing a Flutter application?
Answer:

Data Encryption: Use AES encryption for data at rest and TLS for data in transit.
Authentication: Implement strong user authentication mechanisms, such as OAuth2 or SAML.
Secure APIs: Use HTTPS with certificate pinning to secure API calls.
Input Validation: Protect against injection attacks by validating and sanitizing user inputs.
Least Privilege Principle: Restrict permissions to only what's necessary.
Code Obfuscation: Obfuscate the Dart code using tools like ProGuard or R8.
2. How would you protect sensitive data on the user's device?
Answer:

Use Flutter Secure Storage to store sensitive data in encrypted form.
Avoid storing sensitive data in plain text or in insecure locations like SharedPreferences.
Use Key Management Services (KMS) to manage encryption keys securely.
Implement data retention policies, ensuring sensitive data is erased when no longer needed.
3. How would you secure the communication between the Flutter app and backend services?
Answer:

Use TLS/SSL for all network communications.
Implement certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
Use secure API authentication methods such as JWT tokens with short lifetimes.
Avoid hardcoding API keys in the app; instead, store them securely on the server side.
4. How do you prevent reverse engineering of your Flutter app?
Answer:

Enable code obfuscation with Dart's --obfuscate flag during the build process.
Use ProGuard/R8 for additional obfuscation in native code.
Minimize sensitive logic in the client-side app and move it to the server.
Monitor and respond to tampering by integrating tools like Firebase App Check or third-party solutions.
5. How would you handle user authentication securely in a government application?
Answer:

Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security.
Follow standards like OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect for secure authentication.
Use secure token storage, e.g., store access tokens in an encrypted storage solution.
Ensure session management is robust by implementing automatic session expiration and refresh tokens.
6. How would you protect the app from SQL injection or other common attacks?
Answer:

Use parameterized queries or ORM tools like Firebase Firestore to prevent injection attacks.
Sanitize user inputs before processing.
Employ input validation to ensure data integrity.
7. How do you ensure compliance with local data protection laws and regulations?
Answer:

Research and adhere to the Saudi Data and Privacy Protection Law (PDPL).
Implement data minimization techniques to collect only necessary user data.
Provide transparency by including detailed privacy policies and user consent forms.
Ensure sensitive data is processed and stored locally in Saudi Arabia if required.
8. How would you implement secure file uploads in the app?
Answer:

Validate the file type and size before uploading.
Scan uploaded files for malware.
Store files securely in cloud storage with restricted access policies (e.g., S3 or Firebase Storage).
Use secure URLs for accessing uploaded files with expiration times.
9. How would you secure sensitive information in logs?
Answer:

Avoid logging sensitive information like passwords, API keys, or personal data.
Use a logging framework that supports secure logging practices.
Store logs in a secure, centralized location with restricted access.
10. How would you test the app for security vulnerabilities?
Answer:

Conduct regular penetration testing using tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP.
Perform static application security testing (SAST) using tools like SonarQube.
Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) during the QA phase.
Continuously monitor the app for vulnerabilities using automated tools and address them promptly.
11. How would you protect against DoS/DDoS attacks on the backend?
Answer:

Use rate limiting to prevent abuse of APIs.
Employ a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious traffic.
Use CDN services like Cloudflare to absorb traffic surges.
Monitor traffic patterns and deploy alerts for unusual activity.
12. What measures would you take to ensure the app remains secure post-deployment?
Answer:

Implement automatic updates to patch vulnerabilities quickly.
Monitor the app using security tools like Firebase Crashlytics or third-party solutions.
Perform regular security audits and code reviews.
Keep dependencies and libraries updated to mitigate risks from third-party vulnerabilities.
