Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * class TreeNode {
 *   int val;
 *   TreeNode? left;
 *   TreeNode? right;
 *   TreeNode([this.val = 0, this.left, this.right]);
 * }
 */
class Solution {
  int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode? root) {
    
  }
}

To solve the problem of finding the diameter of a binary tree in Dart, we will use a depth-first search (DFS) approach. Let's break this down step by step.

Problem Explanation
The diameter of a binary tree is defined as the length of the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. This path can pass through the root or might not.

The length of the path is measured in terms of edges, not nodes.
For each node in the tree, the longest path that passes through that node would be the sum of:
The height of its left subtree.
The height of its right subtree.
The solution will involve:

Calculating the height of each subtree.
Keeping track of the maximum diameter encountered.
Approach
DFS Recursive Approach:
Traverse the tree recursively using a helper function that calculates the height of the subtrees.
While calculating the height, update the diameter by checking the sum of the heights of the left and right subtrees for each node.
Implementation in Dart
dart
Copy code
class TreeNode {
  int val;
  TreeNode? left;
  TreeNode? right;
  TreeNode([this.val = 0, this.left, this.right]);
}

class Solution {
  int _maxDiameter = 0;

  int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode? root) {
    _calculateHeight(root);
    return _maxDiameter;
  }

  int _calculateHeight(TreeNode? node) {
    if (node == null) {
      return 0;
    }

    // Recursively get the height of left and right subtrees
    int leftHeight = _calculateHeight(node.left);
    int rightHeight = _calculateHeight(node.right);

    // Update the maximum diameter
    _maxDiameter = _maxDiameter > (leftHeight + rightHeight)
        ? _maxDiameter
        : (leftHeight + rightHeight);

    // Return the height of the current node
    return 1 + (leftHeight > rightHeight ? leftHeight : rightHeight);
  }
}
Explanation
Helper Function:

_calculateHeight(TreeNode? node):
Returns the height of the subtree rooted at node.
Computes the left and right subtree heights recursively.
Updates _maxDiameter with the sum of left and right heights at each node.
Base Case:

If node is null, return 0 (height of an empty subtree is 0).
Main Function:

diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode? root):
Calls _calculateHeight to traverse and compute heights.
Returns the maximum diameter.
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: 
O(N), where 

N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
Space Complexity: 

O(H), where 

H is the height of the tree. This accounts for the recursion stack.
Example
Consider the following binary tree:

    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
The longest path (diameter) is 4 → 2 → 1 → 3 or 5 → 2 → 1 → 3.
The output will be 3 (since there are 3 edges in the longest path).
dart
Copy code
void main() {
  TreeNode root = TreeNode(1);
  root.left = TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4), TreeNode(5));
  root.right = TreeNode(3);

  Solution solution = Solution();
  print(solution.diameterOfBinaryTree(root)); // Output: 3
}

what is the importance of this return

The return statement:

dart
Copy code
return 1 + (leftHeight > rightHeight ? leftHeight : rightHeight);
is important because it calculates and returns the height of the subtree rooted at the current node. Here's a breakdown of its purpose:

Purpose of the Return Statement:
Height Calculation:

The height of a node is defined as the number of edges on the longest path from that node to any leaf node in its subtree.
In this case, the height of the current node is computed as:
dart
Copy code
1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight)
leftHeight: The height of the left subtree.
rightHeight: The height of the right subtree.
1 + ...: Adds 1 to account for the edge between the current node and its child nodes (either left or right).
Why 1 + max(leftHeight, rightHeight)?:

At each node, we are considering the longest path to a leaf node in its left or right subtree.
To compute the height of the current node, we take the height of the higher subtree (either left or right) and add 1 to it to include the edge between the current node and its child.
Example to Illustrate:
For a subtree like:

markdown
Copy code
    2
   / \
  4   5
The height of node 4 and node 5 is 0 because they are leaf nodes.

For node 2, the height is the longest path from 2 to any leaf node. It will be the maximum of the heights of the left and right children (4 and 5), plus 1 for the edge between 2 and its children.

For node 2:

dart
Copy code
return 1 + max(0, 0);  // returns 1
The returned 1 means that the height of node 2 is 1 because it is one edge away from its farthest leaf (either 4 or 5).

Why is this Important in the Context of the Diameter?
The height is used to compute the diameter (the longest path between any two nodes in the tree).
The diameter at each node is calculated as the sum of the heights of its left and right subtrees (leftHeight + rightHeight).
By recursively returning the height of each node and updating the diameter along the way, the algorithm efficiently computes the maximum diameter in a single pass.
Without this return, the recursive function wouldn't be able to propagate the height values upwards to the parent nodes, preventing us from calculating the diameter of the tree.
