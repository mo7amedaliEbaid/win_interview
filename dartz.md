Dartz is a functional programming library for the Dart language.
It provides tools and data types that enable developers to write functional-style code,
focusing on immutability, composability,
and safer handling of operations like errors,
nullability, and asynchronous computations.

Key Features of Dartz
Dartz introduces several functional programming constructs commonly
found in languages like Haskell, Scala, or Elm.
Below are some of its core concepts and utilities:

1. Option
Represents a value that may or may not exist (similar to Dart's null but safer).

Some: Represents a value that exists.
None: Represents the absence of a value.
This helps avoid null checks and NullPointerException-like errors.

Example:

import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';

Option<int> someValue = Some(10);
Option<int> noValue = None();

someValue.match(
  (value) => print("Value is $value"), // Value exists.
  () => print("No value"),            // No value.
); 
2. Either
Represents a computation that can return one of two possible types. Typically used for error handling:

Left: Represents a failure or error.
Right: Represents a success or valid result.

Example:

import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';

Either<String, int> divide(int a, int b) {
  if (b == 0) {
    return Left("Division by zero error");
  } else {
    return Right(a ~/ b);
  }
}

final result = divide(10, 2);
result.fold(
  (l) => print("Error: $l"),  // Left case (error).
  (r) => print("Result: $r"), // Right case (success).
);

3. Task and TaskEither
Task: Encapsulates an asynchronous computation that returns a value.
TaskEither: Similar to Task, but supports error handling like Either.

Example:
import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';

Task<int> asyncTask() => Task(() async => 42);

void main() {
  asyncTask().run().then((value) => print("Value: $value")); // Outputs 42.
}

4. Validation
Provides a way to validate data through a combination of multiple operations.
It's a more advanced form of error aggregation than Either.

5. Functional Utilities
Dartz also provides several utility functions to make functional programming easier:
fold, map, flatMap, filter, etc., for manipulating data structures.
Tuples (immutable, fixed-length collections of values).
Immutable collections like IList and ISet.
Benefits of Using Dartz

Safe Error Handling:

Avoids the traditional try-catch by using Either.
Makes error states explicit and manageable.
Null Safety and Optional Values:

Using Option ensures safer handling of potentially absent values without relying on null.
Immutable Data Structures:

Encourages immutability, which helps avoid bugs related to mutable state.
Composability:

Provides tools like map and flatMap for transforming and chaining operations seamlessly.
Better Abstraction:

Cleaner, more predictable code by modeling operations (success and failure) explicitly.
Example Use Case: API Request with Error Handling

import 'package:dartz/dartz.dart';

Future<Either<String, int>> fetchData() async {
  try {
    // Simulating an API call
    int result = await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1), () => 200);
    return Right(result); // Success case.
  } catch (e) {
    return Left("Failed to fetch data"); // Failure case.
  }
}

void main() async {
  final result = await fetchData();

  result.fold(
    (error) => print("Error: $error"),   // Handle error.
    (data) => print("Data: $data"),      // Handle success.
  );
}
Conclusion
Dartz brings functional programming paradigms to Dart, improving the way developers handle errors, nullability,
and asynchronous computations. It's especially useful in building scalable, predictable,
and maintainable applications, like those with complex data transformations or state management needs.
