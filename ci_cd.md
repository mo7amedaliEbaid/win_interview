what is ci and cd?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (or Deployment).
It is a set of practices in software development aimed at automating and streamlining the process of building,
testing, and deploying applications. These practices are key components of DevOps and Agile methodologies.
Here's a breakdown:

1. Continuous Integration (CI):
Definition: A development practice where developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository,
usually multiple times a day. Each integration is automatically built and tested to catch issues early.

Key Features:
Automated builds.
Automated unit and integration testing.
Immediate feedback on code quality.
Benefits:
Detect and fix bugs early in the development cycle.
Reduce integration challenges.
Improve collaboration among developers.

Example Tools for CI:

Jenkins
GitHub Actions
Travis CI
GitLab CI/CD

2. Continuous Delivery (CD):
Definition: Builds on CI by automating the release process so that code changes can be
deployed to a staging or production environment at any time.
The process ensures the application is always in a deployable state.

Key Features:
Automated deployment pipelines.
Environment-specific testing (e.g., staging, production).
Manual approval gates (optional).

Benefits:
Faster release cycles.
Reduced manual intervention.
Enhanced reliability of releases.

3. Continuous Deployment (CD):
Definition: A step further than Continuous Delivery,
 where every change that passes the automated tests is automatically deployed to production without manual approval.

Key Features:
Fully automated deployment.
Requires highly reliable tests.
Benefits:
Frequent and faster releases.
Immediate delivery of updates and fixes to users.

Example Tools for CD:

Docker
Kubernetes
AWS CodePipeline
Azure DevOps

CI/CD Workflow:
Commit Code: Developers push code to a shared repository.
Build: The CI/CD pipeline triggers an automated build.
Test: Automated tests verify the code's functionality and quality.
Deploy (CD): Depending on the setup, the changes are either:
Deployed to staging (Continuous Delivery) or,
Automatically deployed to production (Continuous Deployment).
Key Takeaway: CI focuses on improving code integration,
while CD ensures faster and more reliable delivery of software to users.
Together, they help teams achieve a seamless and efficient software development lifecycle.
